# AIRDock
AIRDock is a docking library for Adobe AIR based applications, inspired by DockPanelSuite. Much like DockPanelSuite, AIRDock is also highly customizable and allows users to drag and dock panels in your AIR application to windows. 

## Features

## Supported Platforms
Newer features of AIR are not used in favor of compatibility reasons. Also, AIRDock does not use any native extensions to work! As such, its supported platforms are the same as any AIR application, regardless of version. However, it still uses Adobe AIR, so the supported platforms vary depending on the target:

### AIR 2.6+
Adobe dropped support for Linux after AIR 2.6. If you're targeting AIR 2.7 or above, then AIRDock is supported on:
* Windows
* MacOS

### AIR 2.6 or below
Since newer features of the language are not used, AIRDock may -- although it has not been tested -- work on Linux, provided the source is used; the SWC may not work.
