# AIRDock
AIRDock is a docking library for Adobe AIR based applications, inspired by DockPanelSuite. Much like DockPanelSuite, AIRDock is also highly customizable and allows users to drag and dock panels in your AIR application to windows. 

## Features

## Supported Platforms
All the language features used in AIRDock are the same as those present in AIR < 4.0. In practice, this makes little difference in performance or capability, although it means older features like `Vector<T>.splice()` are favoured over `Vector<T>.removeAt()`, and newer features are ideally used as infrequently as possible (or have an easily-replaceable alternative available.) Supported platforms include Windows and Mac, and Linux if targeting AIR < 2.6. Linux capabilities have not been tested yet, however.
