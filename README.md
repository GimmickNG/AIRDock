# AIRDock
A docking library for Adobe AIR, inspired by DockPanelSuite. Should work on both Mac and Windows (and Linux too, if you're targeting versions lesser than AIR 4.0) since it's made in pure AS3 and doesn't rely on native extensions in order to work. Does not require the Flex framework, although it can be used for projects made with Flex too (...in theory, anyways.)
